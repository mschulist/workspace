1. 

a. No, $4.2%$ of people fall into both categories, so they are not disjoint. 

b.

c. 

live below poverty line = B

only speak English = E

$$
P(B \cap E) = 0.042
$$

d. 

$$
P(B \cup E) = P(B) + P(E) - P(B \cap E) = 0.146 + 0.207 - 0.042 = 0.311
$$

e. 

$$
P(B^c \cap E) = P(B^c) P(E) = 0.854 \cdot 0.207 \approx 0.178
$$

f. 

\begin{align*}
P(B \cap E) &= 0.042 \\
P(B)P(E) &= 0.03022
\end{align*}

Because these are not equal, they are independent. Living below the poverty line and speaking a foreign language at home are not independent events and knowing one gives us some information about the other. 

2. 

a. In order to have the first that she gets correct be the fifth question, she needs to get the first 4 incorrect AND get the fifth correct.


\begin{align*}
P(\text{first four incorrect}) &= 0.75^4 \\
P(\text{last one correct}) &= 0.25 \\
P(\text{first four incorrect} \cap \text{last one correct}) &= 0.75^4 \cdot 0.25 = 0.0791
\end{align*}


b. The probability that she gets all of the questions right (assuming independent answers due to randomness) is $P(\text{all correct}) = 0.25^5 = 0.000977$ (not a good idea to guess on a test).

c. The probability of getting at least one correct is the same as not getting all of them wrong. 

$$
P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - 0.75^5 = 0.763
$$

3. 

a.

$$
P(Bl_m \cup Bl_f) = \frac{114}{204} + \frac{108}{204} - \frac{78}{204} = 0.706
$$

b. 

$$
P(Bl_f | Bl_m) = \frac{78}{114} = 0.684
$$

c. 

\begin{align*}
P(Bl_f | Br_m) &= \frac{19}{54} = 0.352 \\ 
P(Bl_f | Gr_m) &= \frac{11}{36} = 0.306
\end{align*}

d. They do not appear to be independent as the probabilities change depending on what they condition on. This is especially true for blue-blue pairs, which has a probability much higher than brown-blue and green-blue (where the first color is the male).
