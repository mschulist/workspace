1. 

a. No, $4.2%$ of people fall into both categories, so they are not disjoint. 

b.

c. 

live below poverty line = B

only speak English = E

$$
P(B \cap E) = 0.042
$$

d. 

$$
P(B \cup E) = P(B) + P(E) - P(B \cap E) = 0.146 + 0.207 - 0.042 = 0.311
$$

e. 

$$
P(B^c \cap E) = P(B^c) P(E) = 0.854 \cdot 0.207 \approx 0.178
$$

f. 

$$
P(B \cap E) = 0.042 \\
P(B)P(E) = 0.03022
$$

Because these are not equal, they are independent. Living below the poverty line and speaking a foreign language at home are not indepedent events and knowing one gives us some information about the other.
